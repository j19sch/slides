	<title>Regression testing, not sure if I'd say we do that...</title>

	<meta name="description"
		content="NWEWT 1 - One of the main responsibilities of my team is our online portal, which consists of several applications. In my talk I will describe this portal and more importantly our way of working:
1) complete user story;
2) combine user stories into a release;
3) test the release;
4) deploy the release.

There are parts of this process one could label as 'regression testing' and some of my teammates do. I myself, however, try to avoid using it more and more. There are several reasons for this, but the main one is that 'regression testing' has so little meaning. It does not specify a quality attribute as for instance security testing, neither does it specify an architectural scope as for instance integration testing. Rather its meaning depends on the models we have about the impact of the changes we made, on the entire product.
And interestingly enough, no one seems to mind. Conversations about regression testing seem to be limited to: 'What are you doing?' 'Regression testing.' 'Ok, carry on.' It's almost like a Jedi mind trick...

And that's the claim I would like to present in my experience report: for every activity in my team's process that could be labeled as 'regression testing', there is a more descriptive label. And we should use that better label.">
