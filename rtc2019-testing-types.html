Which of these don’t belong: functional testing, whitebox testing, regression testing, mobile testing, UI testing?

The answer is all of them. Although they’re all <something> testing, each of them belongs to a different category of types of testing. And unfortunately, we often use these terms in this isolated way, making them lose a large part of their meaning. In my talk we will explore the meaning of several of these ‘<something> testing’ terms. Manual and automated testing. Whitebox and blackbox testing. Unit, integration and UI testing. I will show there are better ways to define the meaning of these terms than through a definition.

For instance by pointing out examples, or by contrasting them with the other terms in the category, or by looking at what’s missing from the category. Why is there no common term for the testing that’s not “regression testing”?

All of this will illustrate that these terms have very little meaning if not connected to a specific context and to specific practices. And it allows us to ask some new questions, such as: what power dynamics can be at play in distinguishing blackbox testing from whitebox testing? The main idea behind this talk is Ludwig Wittgenstein’s argument that the meaning of a word is its use in language. Or put differently, outside of the social conventions of its usage, a word has no meaning. His ideas about language will form the theoretical underpinnings of my talk.">

				<h4>regression testing: Testing of a previously tested component or system following modification to ensure that defects have not been introduced or have been uncovered in unchanged areas of the software, as a result of the changes made.</h4>
				<h4>integration testing: Testing performed to expose defects in the interfaces and in the interactions between integrated components or systems.</h4>
				<h4>functional testing: Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a component or system with functional requirements.</h4>
				<h4>non-functional testing: Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a component or system with non-functional requirements.</h4>
				<h4>white-box testing: Testing based on an analysis of the internal structure of the component or system.</h4>
				<h4>black-box testing: Testing, either functional or non-functional, without reference to the internal structure of the component or system.</h4>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>API testing: Testing performed by submitting commands to the software under test using programming interfaces of the application directly.</h4>
				<h4>negative testing: Tests aimed at showing that a component or system does not work. Negative testing is related to the tester's attitude rather than a specific test approach or test design technique, e.g., testing with invalid input values or exceptions.</h4>
				<h4>positive testing: not defined</h4>

				<h4>system: A collection of interacting elements organized to accomplish a specific function or set of functions.</h4>
				<h4>functional testing: Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a component or system with functional requirements.</h4>
				<h4>compliance: The capability of the software product to adhere to standards, conventions or regulations in laws and similar prescriptions.</h4>

				<h4>non-functional testing: Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a component or system with non-functional requirements.</h4>
				<h4>non-functional requirement: A requirement that describes how the component or system will do what it is intended to do.</h4>
