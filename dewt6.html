	<title>The time I didn't communicate about my testing. Or did I?</title>

	<meta name="description"
		content="DEWT6 - Reading the theme of DEWT6, one project immediately came to mind: the one during which I didn't communicate at all about my team's testing of a middleware solution. No one was 			particularly interested in what we were doing, as long as we did it. And that no one includes the test manager, the project managers and the program manager.
		However, after that first thought about the project, memories starting coming back. And a lot of those memories did involve communuicating about my team's testing with different people, including 			the test manager and some of the project managers. It's just that none (or at least) very little of that communication took the form of typical communication about testing. In my experience 			report I will share several of these somewhat atypical moments of communication.">
